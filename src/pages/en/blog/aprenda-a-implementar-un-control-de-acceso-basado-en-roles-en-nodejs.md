Role-based authentication is a key feature when building a system. If you haven't implemented role-based access control yet, this tutorial will help you do it easily with Node.js.

In this tutorial, you will learn how to set up and develop role-based access control for your Node.js application. We will explain each step in detail, so you can follow the process correctly.

### Prerequisites

Before you start, you should consider the following prerequisites:

- A Node.js development environment.
- Basic knowledge of JavaScript.
- Basic knowledge of Node.js.

### Libraries and Configuration

To develop role-based access control, we need to install some libraries. These are:

- Express.js
- Passport.js
- Passport-local
- Passport-jwt

We will also need to configure a database to store users and their roles. For this, we will use MongoDB.

### Explanation of Each Step

One of the first steps in developing role-based access control is setting up the database. We need to create a collection for users and another for roles. These collections will be used to store user information and their respective roles.

Once the database is set up, we will need to create a route for user registration. This route will allow us to register new users in the database.

We will also need to create a route for logging in. This route will allow us to authenticate users in the application.

Finally, we need to create a route for role-based access control. This route will allow us to control access to certain parts of the application based on user roles.

### Folder Structure

Once weâ€™ve explained each step, we need to organize the files into the appropriate folders. Here is the folder structure:

- `config/`: Here we will store the database configuration.
- `controllers/`: Here we will store the application controllers.
- `models/`: Here we will store the application models.
- `routes/`: Here we will store the application routes.
- `views/`: Here we will store the application views.

### Step-by-Step

Below, we explain step by step how to develop role-based access control with Node.js.

#### Database Configuration

First, we need to set up the database. We will need to create a collection for users and another for roles. These collections will store user information and their respective roles.

#### Creating the Registration Route

Once the database is set up, we need to create a route for user registration. This route will allow us to register new users in the database.

#### Creating the Login Route

We will also need to create a route for logging in. This route will allow us to authenticate users in the application.

#### Creating the Role-Based Access Route

Finally, we need to create a route for role-based access control. This route will allow us to control access to certain parts of the application based on user roles.

### Conclusion

This tutorial has helped you learn how to implement role-based access control in Node.js. We have explained each step in detail so you can follow the process correctly.

Additionally, we have shown how to organize files into the appropriate folders. This will help you have better organization of your application's files.
