Are you learning Python and don't know what project to tackle? Don’t worry! Here we present 71 projects to help you have fun and improve your programming skills.

We found this article on Linkin with 71 projects you can develop, complete with sources to validate your results. The projects range from sentiment analyzers with machine learning to notification applications, a speed typing test, a password manager, a quiz application, a fraudulent credit card detector, and much more.

Here are some projects from the Linkin article:

### Sentiment Analyzer with Machine Learning

A sentiment analyzer is a machine learning tool used to determine the tone or sentiment of a text. This tool can be useful for a variety of applications, such as opinion analysis, spam detection, content recommendation, etc.

To develop a sentiment analyzer with machine learning, you need prior knowledge in Python and machine learning. Start by collecting a dataset to train your model. Then, define a model architecture, train it with the collected data, and evaluate its performance.

### Notification Application

A notification application is a tool that allows you to receive notifications on your phone or computer. This application is useful for keeping track of your activities, such as new messages, appointments, events, etc.

To develop a notification application, you need prior knowledge in Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Start by defining the user interface of your application and programming it with HTML and CSS. Next, program the application logic with JavaScript. Finally, use a notification API so your application can send and receive notifications.

### Password Manager

A password manager is a tool that helps you securely manage your passwords. This tool is useful for keeping your passwords secure and protected from unauthorized access.

To develop a password manager, you need prior knowledge in Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Start by defining the user interface of your application and programming it with HTML and CSS. Next, program the application logic with JavaScript. Finally, use a security API to encrypt and store your passwords securely.

### Fraudulent Credit Card Detector

A fraudulent credit card detector is a tool used to detect fraudulent transactions. This tool is useful for protecting website users from fraud and scams.

To develop a fraudulent credit card detector, you need prior knowledge in Python, machine learning, and neural networks. Start by collecting a dataset to train your model. Then, define a model architecture, train it with the collected data, and evaluate its performance. Finally, use a security API to detect fraudulent transactions.

## Conclusion

As you can see, there is a wide variety of projects you can work on to improve your programming skills and learn more about Python. From sentiment analyzers with machine learning to fraudulent credit card detectors, there is a project for everyone.
