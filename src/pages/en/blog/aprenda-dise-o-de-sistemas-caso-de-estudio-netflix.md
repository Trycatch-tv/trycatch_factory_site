### System Design: The Netflix Case Study

System design is an extremely complex task that requires a great deal of experience and knowledge. That’s why I’m bringing you this article so you can see how decisions were made in the Netflix design case.

In this article, you will find important information about functional requirements, non-functional requirements, extended requirements, business constraints, considerations for traffic, storage, bandwidth, and more. There is also data modeling for each part involved in the system, as well as graphs and the results of the exercise.

#### What is Netflix?

Netflix is one of the most popular streaming platforms in the world. It offers a wide variety of content, from television series to movies, documentaries, and children’s programs. Netflix also has its own original content, such as series, movies, and documentaries.

#### Functional Requirements

Functional requirements are the requirements that a system must meet to satisfy the user's goals. In the case of Netflix, the functional requirements include:

- Offering high-quality content
- Providing an intuitive user interface
- Allowing users to search and discover content
- Offering a personalized user experience
- Providing a content streaming option
- Providing a content download option

#### Non-Functional Requirements

Non-functional requirements are the requirements that a system must meet to satisfy quality goals. In the case of Netflix, the non-functional requirements include:

- System availability
- System performance
- System security
- System scalability
- System maintainability

#### Extended Requirements

Extended requirements are additional requirements that a system must meet to satisfy user goals. In the case of Netflix, the extended requirements include:

- Offering a personalized user experience
- Providing a content streaming option
- Providing a content download option
- Providing a content purchase option
- Providing a content rental option
- Providing a content sharing option

#### Business Constraints

Business constraints are the requirements that a system must meet to satisfy business objectives. In the case of Netflix, the business constraints include:

- Storage costs
- Bandwidth costs
- Traffic costs
- Content licensing costs
- Advertising costs

#### Considerations for Traffic, Storage, and Bandwidth

Traffic, storage, and bandwidth are critical factors in system design. In the case of Netflix, the following factors must be considered:

- Incoming and outgoing traffic
- Storage needed for content
- Bandwidth needed for content streaming

#### Data Modeling

Data modeling is a critical step in system design. In the case of Netflix, the following elements must be considered:

- User modeling
- Content modeling
- Streaming modeling
- Purchase modeling
- Rental modeling
- Sharing modeling

#### Results

The results of Netflix's system design are impressive. The system is scalable, secure, reliable, and offers an intuitive user experience. The system is also capable of handling large amounts of traffic, storage, and bandwidth without issues.

### Conclusion

System design is an extremely complex task that requires a lot of experience and knowledge. In this article, we’ve seen how decisions were made in the Netflix design case. We’ve explored functional requirements, non-functional requirements, extended requirements, business constraints, considerations for traffic, storage, bandwidth, and more. We’ve also reviewed data modeling and the results of Netflix's system design.
