Hello everyone! Iâ€™m very happy to share that my proposal to give a talk at AWS Community Day in Guatemala has been approved. I am excited to share my knowledge at an international event and to meet Edu from Programmer GT.

In this talk, I will address a very important topic: soft skills. These skills are essential for success in any process throughout our professional careers. Therefore, my talk will focus on how we can pay more attention to developing these skills.

In this article, I want to tell you a bit more about what soft skills are, why they are important, and how we can improve them.

### What Are Soft Skills?

Soft skills are interpersonal skills, meaning skills related to behavior and interaction with others. These include skills such as communication, collaboration, creativity, empathy, conflict management, active listening, problem-solving, decision-making, leadership, and resilience.

Unlike technical skills, which can be learned through training, soft skills are developed over time. They are essential for success in any area of life.

### Why Are Soft Skills Important?

Soft skills are essential for professional success. These skills are key to standing out from others and achieving success in our careers.

Soft skills are important because they help us work as a team, develop professional relationships, communicate effectively, solve problems creatively, make sound decisions, and lead projects.

Additionally, soft skills are important for productivity. People with a good set of soft skills are more productive and can work more efficiently. This means they can achieve better results in less time.

### How Can We Improve Our Soft Skills?

Although soft skills are difficult to learn, there are some things we can do to improve them.

First, we should work on our self-esteem and confidence. This means we need to work on our communication, listening skills, and ability to work as a team.

Additionally, we should work on our problem-solving skills. This means learning to recognize problems, identify solutions, and make sound decisions.

Finally, we should work on our leadership skills. This means learning to motivate and guide others, delegate tasks, and work as a team to achieve goals.

### Conclusion

Soft skills are essential for success in our careers. These skills cannot be learned overnight; they are developed over time. Therefore, we must work on our self-esteem and confidence, problem-solving abilities, and leadership skills to improve our soft skills.

I am very pleased that my talk on soft skills for AWS Community Day in Guatemala was approved. I am sure it will be a great experience, and I hope everyone who attends will learn something new.

See you in Guatemala!
